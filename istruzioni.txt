 Modificare uno scipt per usarlo con midigrid:
-----------------------------------------------

USO #1:
    generally, scripts with grid support will have a grid variable at the top. for example
    local g
    or local grid
    or local grid_device (iâ€™ll use this in the examples below)

    replace it with:
    local <var name> = util.file_exists(_path.code.."midigrid") and include "midigrid/lib/mg_128" or grid

USO #2:
    if the script only uses g = grid.connect then add a line above that with
    
    local grid = util.file_exists(_path.code.."midigrid") and include "midigrid/lib/mg_128" or grid

IMPORTANTE:
    to avoid that scripts auto-connect to your midigrid controller and use it as a normal midi device, make sure your 
    controller is not in norns' midi devices list or that dummy devices are in slots 1 and 2 (e.g. the virtual midi device). 
    this way your controller stays free and can be used as a midigrid.
