how to edit a script
here’s a little tutorial on how to make scripts work with midigrid.

1st step:
generally, scripts with grid support will have a grid variable at the top. for example

local g
or local grid
or local grid_device (i’ll use this in the examples below)

replace it with:
local grid_device = util.file_exists(_path.code.."midigrid") and include "midigrid/lib/mg_128" or grid

this will check wether midigrid is installed and if so, assign it to the grid_device variable. if midigrid is not installed, it will assign the original grid resources instead.

if the script uses local g or local grid then change the above snippet to use that at the beginning.

if the script only uses g = grid.connect then add a line above that with
local grid = util.file_exists(_path.code.."midigrid") and include "midigrid/lib/mg_128" or grid

to avoid that scripts auto-connect to your midigrid controller and use it as a normal midi device, make sure your controller is 
not in norns' midi devices list or that dummy devices are in slots 1 and 2 (e.g. the virtual midi device). this way your controller stays free and can be used as a midigrid.
